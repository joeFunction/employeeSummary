####Discription

In this application, page generation is done through the command line. The application will prompt the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can then input any number of team members. The application also passes a series of unit tests. When the user has completed building the team, the application will generate an HTML file that displays a uniform roster base that was prompted from the information provided by the user.
